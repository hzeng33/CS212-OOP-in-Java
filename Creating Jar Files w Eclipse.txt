Creating a Jar File using Eclipse 
 

Right click on the project for which you want to create the jar file and choose Export > Java >  JAR file.

JAR files can contain either compiled code, source code, or both. By default, Eclipse assumes you're exporting 
compiled code, so it only lists .class files and other files required by the compiled code.

To change this, modify the checkboxes right below the folder/file windows so that "Export generated class files
 and resources" is unchecked and "Export java source files and resources" is checked. If you are submitting a 
project via a JAR file and you forget to do this, you will not provide your .java files.

Choose a location on your computer for your JAR file and then hit "Finish". You are now ready to submit the jar 
file you just saved.

You can test whether or not your JAR file worked by creating a new Project, right click on it, and import your
 JAR file from an Archive into that new project. If the new project you created looks just like your original 
project, chances are your export worked correctly.
